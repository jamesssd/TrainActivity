# TrainActivity

In this application, the user gets the chance to use this to figure out his or her train schedule. 

I have used JavaScript, CSS, HTML and Firebase(to save the train input by the users).

Issues:
While coding this application, I experience uncaught typeerror of the property "trim".

Shoutout:
I couldn't accomplish this application without the help of YouTube and Google.
